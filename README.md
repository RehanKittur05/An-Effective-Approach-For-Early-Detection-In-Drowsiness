Title: An Effective Approach For Early Detection In Drowsiness

Description: Developed a real-time drowsiness detection system using computer vision and machine learning techniques to enhance driver safety by alerting them when signs of fatigue are detected.

Key Features:
*Real-time Eye and Facial Monitoring: Utilized OpenCV for real-time video stream processing to detect and track eye movements and facial expressions.
*Drowsiness Detection Algorithm: Implemented a machine learning model to analyze eye closure duration and head position, distinguishing between normal blinking and drowsiness.
*Alert Mechanism: Integrated an alert system that triggers an audible alarm and visual warning when drowsiness is detected.
*User Interface: Designed an intuitive interface to display real-time video feed, detection status, and alert notifications.

Technologies Used
Programming Languages: Python
Libraries and Tools: OpenCV, Dlib,Scipy
Hardware: Webcam for live video feed

Achievements:
Successfully achieved an accuracy rate of over 97.72% in drowsiness detection.
Implemented a robust and efficient system capable of processing video feed in real-time with minimal latency.
Demonstrated the system's effectiveness through extensive testing and validation on various datasets.
